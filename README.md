# Plant Finder Project
provides users with personalized plant recommendations based on specific criteria they input into a form. The app will integrate with a plant API to retrieve detailed information about various plants, including whether they are edible, safe for pets and kids, their watering needs, sunlight exposure requirements, and lifespan. The app will then process this data to present the three best plant options that meet the userâ€™s criteria.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
