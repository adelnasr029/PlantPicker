# Plant Finder Project
provides users with personalized plant recommendations based on specific criteria they input into a form. The app will integrate with a plant API to retrieve detailed information about various plants, including whether they are edible, safe for pets and kids, their watering needs, sunlight exposure requirements, and lifespan. The app will then process this data to present the three best plant options that meet the userâ€™s criteria.
